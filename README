This package contains some packages for Agilia linux, 
that are not yet mainlined, but still needed if you are in 
electronics (as me) and work with avr and msp430.
edit vars at the very top of Makefile to point at
the output dir for packages. And add that dir as a repo manually. 
Then just run make.
